# Slap Chat iOS

### About
This project was inspired by a messaging app project from my iOS bootcamp taught by Angela Yu on Udemy. I took this project and made a large part of it my own. I designed most of the UI, color scheme, launch screen and fonts. 
Upon opening the app you will have the option to log in or register to a new account. Once logged in, it functions as a typical messaging application with a slight twist. Upon pressing the send button, you will hear a slap sound ensuring your message was sent successfully.  
Skills learned and tools used in this project are as follows: Advance screen segues, Database use and linking via Google Firebase Firestore, Autolayout, UI/UX designs, Cocoa pods, third party libraries, MVC practices, .xib file for modular functions, Navigation bar functions.
